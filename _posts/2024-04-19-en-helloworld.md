# Hello :)
## Welcome to my website !

This was made with :
* Github Pages
* Jekyll
* Chirpy starter and theme

This was surprisingly easy to make :).
If you want to make your own, use these sites:

```javascript
https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q

https://heckintechin.tech/posts/GitHub-Pages-Jekyll/
```

And also vs code :
```javascript
https://code.visualstudio.com/
```
If you're on linux and want the flatpak version, here it is:
```javascript
https://flathub.org/apps/com.visualstudio.code
```
Thanks for seeing my website !
