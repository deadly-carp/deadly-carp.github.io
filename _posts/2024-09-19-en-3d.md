# Hello, again
## it's been a while

Hello to everyone that reads my "blog" (idk what to call this spaghetti code).

I'm still online and i've been doing some stuff such as learning blender.

Here's some cool stuff i've made ! :

### The classic donuts

I also made a youtube video (it's not great) :
{% include embed/youtube.html id='PIKOtFZK-MY' %}

These renders were made on Blender, you can find it at (https://www.blender.org), it's free so don't hesitate to test it.

Anyways thx for reading, i will probably make another video sometime soon :D.
