# They found Like The Wind !!
## *With some context*

### What is Like The Wind ?
It's a song on the internet that's also called The Most Mysterious Song (of the internet) (It's also abreviated TMMS and LTW).
It's classified as a Lost Media and Lost Wave. 
Now we know that it's actually called "Subways of Your Mind" and was made by the german band *FEX*.

### The search.
It's a song that was actively trying to be found by the TMMS & Lost Wave community on the internet for 17 years.
One day in the 80's, a german guy named Darius S. was recording music from the radio (Norddeutscher Rundfunk on the program "Music Für Junge Leute) on a cassette and forgot about it.

Many years later in 2007 Darius's older sister,  posted the song to multiple forums and no one could remember who made it.

They eventually made a discord server and a reddit. Many rabbit holes and leads were found but not a single one lead to the original creators.
But one day, a user by the name of u/marjin1412 posted on reddit that he was researching hörfest bands when he stumbled on FEX and got in touch with a member to try to get some materials from the old band and managed to get a few demos.
He saw that one of the songs was called "Subways of Your Mind".

He listened to it and understood it was LTW. He told the band member that it was a very famous song on the internet and they let him publish it. 


Here's the audio found on the 4th of November 2024 :

The internet (specially the lost media community) is on a roll this year specially between the finding of Ulterior Motives and Celebrity No.6.
